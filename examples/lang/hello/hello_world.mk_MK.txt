___Здраво свету!
___This string is just a comment, because it is never used within 'helloworld' code!
You should notice that the pattern here is: '\n', '_', '_', '_'.
It contains a newline char at beginning of the pattern, as suggested on this project's page.
This is how you could do to get every string started in the beginning of the line, and
still get a fully functional pattern as well.
Also remember that pattern must be something you will never use within strings!
